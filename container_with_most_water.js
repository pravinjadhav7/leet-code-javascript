// Container With Most Water
// You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

// Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

// Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

// Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

// Example 1:


// Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
// Output: 49
// Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
// Example 2:

// Input: height = [1,1]
// Output: 1
 

// Constraints:

// n == height.length
// 2 <= n <= 105
// 0 <= height[i] <= 104

/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
